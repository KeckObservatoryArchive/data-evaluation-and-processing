(NOTE: This is a super detailed list of development TODOs.)
(NOTE: High level todos also listed in github projects page.)  



===HIGH===
- Update NIRES live DEP with new version?
- Change DEP to look for optional full semid in progname/progid.  (ie 2019A_C123)
- How do we keep track of sdata dirs?  A: Added by Jchock and we aren't necessarily notified.  Need better system.
- Overhaul scrubber checks system (which verifies data has been archived before deleting from sdata).
- Q: Do we need 'ls -d' calls to ensure refresh of /s/sdata mounts?  Possibly not.
- Put in check/warning if cron/run is at a different hour than self.endTime 
- Need end of day cron to ensure all instruments processing ran and completed (query koatpx?)
- Find and fix remaining hard-coded API URLS.
- Search TODOs in code



===LOW PRIORITY===
- Increase PROGPI colwidth to 48 and do First + Last Name?
- READ env data file once.  Write null values if no data. (see MOSFIRE 2017-11-21)
- Look at old Missing Data tables usage
- Sort metadata by timestamp? (currently sorted by KOAID which has 'NR'/'NI' prefix sort first)
- Metadata graph demo with Pyviz + jupyter notebook
- Add "duplicate metadata keyword" check.  What to do? (ok if same val, otherwise ?)
- Make get_dir_list more readable (use glob function?) (just list them) (put in config)
- Review all koatpx columns vs which ones we touch and when (ie zero files)
- Improve logging and reporting more.



===MISC===
- Change processing steps to classes and have them create their own instrObj, log, etc.  Move common to processing base?
- Make instrument.py a better base class; denote which functions/vars must be defined abstract methods.
- Do instrObj header fixes up front so we can just refer to things in the header as header['name']?
- Change back to instrument.py and subclasses as a FITS service class (ie not holding current fits file etc)?
- Command line option for dir removal and tpx removal if running manually?
- Create command line option to force program assignment by outdir or timerange.
- Processing instructions for sub-steps (ie just running make_fits_extension_metadata_files)
- Remove command line options from config so we can just do --modtimeOverride instead of --modtimeOverride=1?
- Make more functions as independent processing steps.
- Rename dep_tar to dep_package.  Move fits gzip step to dep_package (move koatpx.size calc as well as well).
- Pull out metadata from DQA so it can be run as independent step after DQA? 
- Change keyword metadata defs to database tables?  Coordinate with IPAC.
- Change instr classes to use wildcard for locate dirs (see dep_locate.csh, ie set subdir = '/s/sdata7*/esi*')



===CIT===
- Create test directory with collection of sample non-proprietary FITS files and corresponding "gold standard" DEP output for comparison.
- Create test script to validate DEP against sample FITS test directory.




=== FULL KEYWORDS===
!- Decide on extended header naming convention and file format (name, num, name+num?)
!- New keyword: CAMERA (see ESI)
- Order of work: NIRES, MOSFIRE, (NIRSPEC?), ESI, DEIMOS
- Create a script that will search a directory for fits files for a particular instrument (prefix check?) and report on the different header keywords it found, how many times each appear, what the comment is, and if it looks like it has discrete values, and what the max size is and the data type.  Also report on extensions found.  Script will save results to a dataframe and can take a dataframe as input to pick up where it left off.

===MOSFIRE===
!- Due July 8th
!- Verify KOAIMTYP function is correct (see metadata check warns)? 

- MOSFIRE data from 2012 has these extra keywords:
GRPSDONE=                    2 / Groups actually completed in this coadd        
TIME-OBS= '21:34:26.953'       / UT start time of exposure                      
TIME-END= '21:34:33.718'       / UT end time of exposure (after last read)      

- Keyword format issues:

===ESI===

!- Change CAMERA to OBSMODE
!- Update WAVE* and SPECRES keywords
!- Get calibration associated keywords from Jim based on spreadsheet
!- Chnage WAVE* to angstroms

---Ignoring these warnings (can't fix but doesn't affect archiving)---

var type of str, expected double (ROTCALAN=0.00)
var type of str, expected double (ROTERCNT=0)

---New keywords---
CAMERA (imag, spec)

---Need to implement these---

- Q: How can we determine imaging or spectrograph mode?  I don't see a keyword specifying this.
- Q: What is the wavelength range?  3900 Å to 10900 Å?  Does it change for imag/spec?  
- Q: What is the nominal spectral resolution?
- Q: What is CCD pixel scale, dispersion and spatial  (arcsec/pixel)?
- Q: Need to calculate NPIXSAT (# of saturated pixels), but I don't see a SATURATE level keyword.




===NIRES===
- Updates to pyDEP might have fixed some things (split nights, oa/oar fix (2019-03-22))
- add to nires spreadsheet?  Should we add these or ignore?: DISPNAME2, SCRIPTNAME, SCRIPTDIR, WIDTH, HEIGHT, XPOS, YPOS, ROIMAXDIM
- WARNING - metadata check: var type of str, expected double (EQUINOX=2000.0)

(NOTE: This is a super detailed list of development TODOs.)
(NOTE: High level todos also listed in github projects page.)  



===HIGH===
- Change DEP to look for optional full semid in progid.  (ie 2019A_C123)
- How do we keep track of sdata dirs?  A: Added by Jchock and we aren't necessarily notified.  Need better system.
- Overhaul scrubber checks system (which verifies data has been archived before deleting from sdata).
- Q: Do we need 'ls -d' calls to ensure refresh of /s/sdata mounts?  Possibly not.
- Put in check/warning if cron/run is at a different hour than self.endTime 
- Need end of day cron to ensure all instruments processing ran and completed.



===LOW PRIORITY===
- Look at old Missing Data tables usage
- Sort metadata by timestamp? (currently sorted by KOAID which has 'NR'/'NI' prefix sort first)
- Metadata graph demo with Pyviz + jupyter notebook
- Add "duplicate metadata keyword" check.  What to do? (ok if same val, otherwise ?)
- Make get_dir_list more readable (use glob function?) (just list them) (put in config)
- Review all koatpx columns vs which ones we touch and when (ie zero files)
- Improve logging and reporting more.



===MISC===
- Change processing steps to classes and have them create their own instrObj, log, etc.  Move common to processing base?
- Make instrument.py a better base class; denote which functions/vars must be defined abstract methods.
- Do instrObj header fixes up front so we can just refer to things in the header as header['name']?
- Change back to instrument.py and subclasses as a FITS service class (ie not holding current fits file etc)?
- Command line option for dir removal and tpx removal if running manually?
- Create command line option to force program assignment by outdir or timerange.
- Processing instructions for sub-steps (ie just running make_fits_extension_metadata_files)
- Remove command line options from config so we can just do --modtimeOverride instead of --modtimeOverride=1?
- Make more functions as independent processing steps.
- Rename dep_tar to dep_package.  Move fits gzip step to dep_package (move koatpx.size calc as well as well).
- Pull out metadata from DQA so it can be run as independent step after DQA? 


===CIT===
- Create test directory with collection of sample non-proprietary FITS files and corresponding "gold standard" DEP output for comparison.
- Create test script to validate DEP against sample FITS test directory.




=== FULL KEYWORDS===
!- Decide on extended header naming convention and file format (name, num, name+num?)
- Order of work: NIRES, MOSFIRE, (NIRSPEC?), ESI, DEIMOS
- Create a script that will search a directory for fits files for a particular instrument (prefix check?) and report on the different header keywords it found, how many times each appear, what the comment is, and if it looks like it has discrete values, and what the max size is and the data type.  Also report on extensions found.  Script will save results to a dataframe and can take a dataframe as input to pick up where it left off.



===MOSFIRE===
- Run one month per year (stagger)
- Verify KOAIMTYP function is correct (see metadata check warns)?
- See processing for 2018-12-23: Problems with PROGID, PROGINST, detecting split night, getproginfo, etc ( see compare)
- ToO test: /net/storageserver/koastorage02/MOSFIRE/stage/MOSFIRE/20160118/

- MOSFIRE data from 2012 has these extra keywords:
GRPSDONE=                    2 / Groups actually completed in this coadd        
TIME-OBS= '21:34:26.953'       / UT start time of exposure                      
TIME-END= '21:34:33.718'       / UT end time of exposure (after last read)      

- Keyword format issues:

- Q: How can we determine imaging or spectrograph mode?  I don't see a keyword specifying this.
- Q: What is the wavelength range?  3900 Å to 10900 Å?  Does it change for imag/spec?  
- Q: What is the nominal spectral resolution?
- Q: What is CCD pixel scale, dispersion and spatial  (arcsec/pixel)?
- Q: Need to calculate NPIXSAT (# of saturated pixels), but I don't see a SATURATE level keyword.




===NIRES===
- add to nires spreadsheet?  Should we add these or ignore?: DISPNAME2, SCRIPTNAME, SCRIPTDIR, WIDTH, HEIGHT, XPOS, YPOS, ROIMAXDIM
- WARNING - metadata check: var type of str, expected double (EQUINOX=2000.0)

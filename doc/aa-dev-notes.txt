===progid assignment outline===
- dep_obtain gets list of programs for the instrument that night plus OA and observers list
  -- NOTE: new code includes start/end times, but for old data we do not have this which affects progInfo later
  -- NOTE: new code will run the old dep obtain if need be
- dep_locate gets 24-fits files list
  -- NOTE: For old data reprocessing, we override the search dir to point to /lev0/ but for some data this is not the true OUTDIR which affects progInfo later.
- create_prog gathers info on a per-image basis, including OUTDIR, PROGID, PROGPI, PROGTITL, PROGINST
  -- When getting OUTDIR, it first looks for keyword.  If none, then it creates one from the search file path (which is useless and misleading for processing old data that didn't have the staging dir output files.)
  -- Tries to get PROGNAME/PROGID from header (processing old /lev0/ data should have PROGID)
  -- FOR PROGPI/INST/TITL it also tries to get from header (for old /lev0/ data)
  -- If we found a PROGID keyword, this is great and we can retrieve PROGPI/INST/TITL if need be
  -- Q: We use the proposals API for INST/PI and koa API for TITL here.  Why not use obtain output? Is it b/c the old dep_obtain had to deal with concatenating field values and so API is unambiguous?
  -- If we don't have a PROGID, we will rely on dep_obtain output later in progInfo to figure this out
- progInfo
  -- Reads dep_obtain output for list of programs
  -- Reads createprog output and looks for any Engineering or ToO markers and assigns them right away.
  -- If no programs, placeholders would be written for PROG* and DQA will set them to "NONE" and warn.
  -- If one program, will assign to the one program for that night (skipping any that are already assigned)
  -- If two or more programs:
    -- Will attempt to figure out what program each outdir belongs to (using program start/end times)
      -- NOTE: for processing old /lev0/ data, everything go consolidated into one outdir so this method will not work.  And we don't have program start/end times either, so we have no way of determining assignments.  That is why we added looking for PROG* info in header at the createprog step.
    -- If outdir analysis is inconclusive

- Percy Gomez is NIRES instrument master
- KOA API is kept alive with cron on www that runs every 10 minutes to make sure API is running.  You can stop it with: /home/www/public/software/db_api/pyServer/dbServer.csh stop 50001
(Let the cron start it back up, though, until we fix the terminal issue.)

===keyword map explained===
- instrument.py contains a dictionary var self.keywordMap with key value pairs.  
- An entry's key is how we will reference a certain keyword in the code.
- An entry's value is the actual keyword string to look for in the FITS header.  
- An entry's value can instead be an array denoting an order list of possible keyword strings to look for.
- An instrument subclass (ie instr_nires.py) can add or overwrite keywordMap entires
- Instrument.py now has a get_keyword and set_keyword functions that use keywordMap to access and modify keywords.



===Processing Notes===

How to run DEP on test data:
- Copy fits data to a test directory (use -p option to preserve timestamps)
- Clone DEP from git
- Create config.live.ini
 -- Edit ROOTDIR to point to your output directory for these test runs.
 -- Edit LOCATE_DIR to point to the test directory to search for FITS files
 -- Edit ADMIN_EMAIL to go to you.
 -- Optional: If you don't have appropriate timestamps on the fits files, turn on LOCATE_MODTIME_OVERRIDE.
- Run DEP with TPX flag off and up to tar step (don't koaxfr): python dep_go.py MOSFIRE 2019-01-20 0 obtain tar

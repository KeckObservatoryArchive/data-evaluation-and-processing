===Creating metadata format file===
- Get latest spreadsheet definition file (currently in Google docs, owned by Jeff)
- Export columns in this order: Keyword, DataType, ColSize, AllowNulls
- Make sure KOAID is first keyword row
- Save to repo as /metadata/keywords.format.<INSTR> (ie "keywords.format.NIRES")
